				<h1>The perfect weekend gateway</h1>
				<p>With that in mind, we dive into the anatomy of the perfect long weekend in this week's Travelogue podcast—sharing real stats (fact: more people are taking more long weekends) and lessons learned from our own trips. Like: You can't do everything in a weekend. Pick two, maybe three things you can't leave without doing—like that museum's exhibit you've been seeing all over Instagram and the one restaurant you have to make a reservation at—and call it a success. You can't let FOMO win when you're traveling for a long weekend; remember, you'll be able to come back when the next flight deal or holiday weekend comes around. One more great tip? Turn off your phone. You're OOO for one day. Work will go on without you.</p>

							<h1>American dream</h1>
							<p>The term was coined by writer and historian James Truslow Adams in his best-selling 1931 book "Epic of America."  He described it as ""that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement." He went on to explain, "It is a difficult dream for the European upper classes to interpret adequately, and too many of us ourselves have grown weary and mistrustful of it. It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position.</p>
